# Project Tasks

This file tracks outstanding tasks for the Lazy Dice Master project. Tasks are prioritized based on discovery analysis and requirements document. Each task should have a corresponding GitHub issue.

## High Priority (Immediate)
- [ ] Add user authentication and multi-user campaign support (integrate Firebase Auth fully).
- [ ] Create .env.example with required environment variables (GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY, Firebase config).
- [ ] Generate and add missing config files: next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js.

## Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Implement export functionality for generated content (PDF/Markdown formats).
- [ ] Expand AI flows: Add full session outline generator, integrate with Lazy GM's 5e Monster Builder.
- [ ] Improve mobile UX: Test and optimize responsive components (e.g., Tiptap editor on mobile).

## Low Priority (Future)
- [ ] Add automated testing suite (unit tests for AI flows, integration tests for Firebase).
- [ ] Performance optimizations: Implement lazy loading for AI-generated images/maps.
- [ ] Documentation: Update README.md with setup instructions, contribution guidelines.
