# Description

Verify the campaign persistence functionality after the fix in TASK-REPAIR-SAVELOAD-20250929-0502.md. Test that selecting or creating a campaign persists across browser restarts. Run the development server with `npm run dev` (which starts on port 9002). Check multiple scenarios:
- Creating a new campaign
- Selecting an existing one
- Closing and reopening the browser
- Ensuring no data loss

Document results, including screenshots or logs if possible. If issues found, report them as new bugs. If successful, mark the original fix task as verified.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Dev server starts successfully without errors
- New campaign creation saves to localStorage and persists after browser restart
- Existing campaign selection restores correctly after browser close/reopen
- No data loss observed in campaign details
- Test report includes pass/fail for each scenario
- If fix works, update original task status to verified

# Checklist
- [âœ…] Start development server: Run `npm run dev` and confirm app loads at http://localhost:9002 (Used pnpm run dev; server now running in Terminal 4 without errors)
- [ ] Test Scenario 1: Create a new campaign and verify it saves (check localStorage via dev tools)
- [ ] Test Scenario 2: Close browser, reopen, and confirm the new campaign is active
- [ ] Test Scenario 3: Select an existing campaign, close/reopen browser, confirm selection persists
- [ ] Test Scenario 4: Verify no data loss (e.g., campaign name, details remain)
- [ ] Document results in notes section or separate artifact
- [ ] If successful, update TASK-REPAIR-SAVELOAD-20250929-0502.md to mark as verified
- [ ] Report any new issues found as bugs
