# Task Description

This task performs onboarding discovery for an existing project. The intent is to analyze the current codebase, documentation, and configuration to generate:

- Stack Profile: A JSON summary of the technology stack, dependencies, and key configurations.
- Requirements Doc: A markdown document outlining project goals, features, workflows, and adherence to development standards.

Follow the provided workflow for high-quality development:
1. Create GitHub issues for tasks.
2. Use branch-based development.
3. Commit with issue references.
4. Submit PRs with reviews.
5. Prioritize outstanding tasks from project-tasks.md.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Stack profile JSON created at `.ruru/context/stack_profile.json` with accurate tech summary.
- Requirements.md created at `.ruru/docs/requirements.md` covering project overview and standards.
- Task log initialized and updated as progress is made.
- Any outstanding tasks reviewed and noted.

# Checklist
- [ ] Use codebase_search to explore project structure and key components (tech stack, main features)
- [ ] Read and analyze package.json, next.config.js, and other config files
- [ ] Review docs/lazy_gm/ directory for core documentation and features
- [ ] Examine src/ directory for code structure and implementations
- [ ] Generate and write stack_profile.json
- [ ] Compile and write requirements.md
- [ ] Review project-tasks.md for outstanding tasks and create issues if needed
- [ ] Update task status to "ðŸŸ¢ Done" upon completion
