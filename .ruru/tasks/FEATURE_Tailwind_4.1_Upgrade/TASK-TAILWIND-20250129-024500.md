# Upgrade Project to Tailwind CSS 4.1

## Description
Upgrade the project from the current Tailwind CSS configuration to version 4.1 by removing the `tailwind.config.ts` file and ensuring the CSS-based configuration in `src/app/globals.css` is properly set up.

## Context
- Current setup uses `tailwind.config.ts` with TypeScript configuration
- Target is Tailwind CSS 4.1 which uses CSS-first configuration approach
- The `src/app/globals.css` file already contains Tailwind directives and CSS custom properties

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `tailwind.config.ts` file is completely removed
- [ ] `src/app/globals.css` contains proper Tailwind 4.1 configuration
- [ ] All existing styling continues to work after upgrade
- [ ] CSS custom properties are properly configured for theming
- [ ] Project builds successfully without errors

## Checklist
- [ ] Analyze current Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- [ ] Verify `src/app/globals.css` has correct Tailwind 4.1 setup
- [ ] Remove `tailwind.config.ts` file
- [ ] Test that project builds and styling works
- [ ] Update any documentation if needed
