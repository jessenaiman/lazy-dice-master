# Task Description

## Goal
Onboard the provided development workflow into the existing project. This includes creating GitHub issues for outstanding tasks, setting up branch-based development practices, ensuring commit and PR standards, and prioritizing tasks from project-tasks.md (if exists) or generating one.

## Initial Context
- Project: Existing (lazy-dice-master, Next.js 15 with TypeScript, AI flows, etc.)
- User Request: Implement workflow for issues, branches, commits, PRs, and handle outstanding tasks.
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/jessenaiman/lazy-dice-master.git

## Acceptance Criteria
- Task log initialized.
- Discovery delegated and completed, producing Stack Profile and Requirements Doc.
- Journal structure checked/created.
- project-tasks.md created/updated with tasks derived from workflow.
- Initial GitHub issues created via MCP for prioritized tasks.
- Report completion with summary.

## Checklist
- [ ] Initialize task log (this file)
- [ ] Delegate discovery for analysis
- [ ] Review discovery results
- [ ] Check/create journal structure (.ruru/)
- [ ] Optionally gather additional context
- [ ] Create/update project-tasks.md
- [ ] Create GitHub issues for tasks
- [ ] Report completion to coordinator

## Progress Log

**2025-09-29T06:12:16Z - Discovery Delegated & Completed:** Delegated to agent-context-discovery (Task ID: TASK-DISC-20250929-060641). Received Stack Profile (.ruru/context/stack_profile.json) and Requirements Doc (.ruru/docs/requirements.md). Reviewed: Confirmed Next.js/TypeScript stack with AI/ Firebase integration. Requirements include workflow standards.

**2025-09-29T06:10:38Z - Journal Structure Verified:** .ruru directory exists with required subdirs (tasks/, docs/, context/). No creation needed.

**2025-09-29T06:10:55Z - project-tasks.md Created:** Generated from discovery/requirements analysis. Lists high/medium/low priority tasks (e.g., auth, exports, testing).

**2025-09-29T06:12:16Z - GitHub Issues Creation Failed:** Attempted to create initial issue via GitHub MCP for high-priority task (auth). Error: "Bad credentials". Logged failure. Automated issue creation blocked; recommend manual setup or credential configuration.

**Next:** Report completion to roo-commander, noting setup complete but issues require manual handling.
