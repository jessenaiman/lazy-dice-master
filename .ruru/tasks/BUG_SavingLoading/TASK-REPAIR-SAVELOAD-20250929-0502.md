# Description

The saving and loading functionality is currently not working. Investigate the issue, fix it, ensure all implemented features are thoroughly documented and tested. Create a GitHub issue to track this problem. Follow a consistent workflow: after completing each item on the todo list, commit changes with meaningful commit messages that detail the progress made. Upon completion of their tasks, agents must always submit a detailed report outlining what requires review. Instruct agents not to claim success; instead, they should request review by specifying all the code files, functions, or modules they modified or added. These review reports must be incorporated into a final check-in before an agent concludes their work and returns to the management mode.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Identify the root cause of the saving/loading issue
- Implement fixes to resolve the issue
- Document all implemented features thoroughly
- Create tests that verify the saving and loading functionality
- Create a GitHub issue with details of the problem and the fix
- Ensure commits are made with meaningful messages after each major step
- Submit a detailed review report listing all modified/added files, functions, modules

# Notes

## Current Implementation Analysis (Lead Frontend, 2025-09-29)

### Files Involved in Saving/Loading:
- `src/app/campaigns/page.tsx`: Manages campaign selection using localStorage with key 'lazy-gm-active-campaign-id'
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Similar localStorage usage for campaign selection
- `src/lib/firebase-service.ts`: Firebase functions for CRUD operations on campaigns, session preps, items
- `src/app/prep/[id]/page.tsx`: Session prep page saving notes via Firebase
- `src/components/tiptap-editor.tsx`: TipTap editor component for rich text editing

### Current Saving/Loading Mechanism:
1. **Campaign Selection Persistence**: Uses localStorage to store active campaign ID (key: 'lazy-gm-active-campaign-id')
   - Set when selecting a campaign
   - Retrieved on page load to restore active campaign state

2. **Data Persistence**: Firebase Firestore for persistent storage
   - Campaigns: created, updated, deleted via Firebase functions
   - Session Preps: notes saved as HTML content to Firestore
   - Items: CRUD operations via Firebase

3. **Rich Text Editing**: TipTap editor converts content to HTML on change, saved to Firebase via updateSessionPrep

### Code Review Findings:
- No obvious bugs found in the reviewed code
- localStorage usage appears correct for client-side state persistence
- Firebase integration follows standard patterns
- TipTap editor properly updates parent component on content changes
- Session prep saving triggers on content changes with proper debouncing

### Potential Issues Identified:
- No specific bugs found in the implementation
- Implementation appears functionally correct

**Next Steps**: Since no bugs were identified in the code review, may need user feedback on specific scenarios where saving/loading fails, or additional testing to reproduce the issue.
