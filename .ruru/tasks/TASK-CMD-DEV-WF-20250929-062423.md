# Task Description

## Goal
Take full command of the development workflow: Resolve git conflicts, ensure repo up-to-date, then implement high-priority issues (#2 Auth, #3 .env.example, #4 Config files) using Git flow (branches, conventional commits, draft PRs). Delegate to specialists as needed. Maintain clean history.

## Context
- Repo: https://github.com/jessenaiman/lazy-dice-master (private)
- Current State: Merge conflict from git pull origin main (conflicts in .env, .gitignore, package.json, src/components/generative-block.tsx, etc.)
- Issues to Implement:
  1. #2: Add user authentication and multi-user campaign support with Firebase Auth
  2. #3: Create .env.example with required environment variables
  3. #4: Generate missing configuration files (next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Git repo resolved and up-to-date with main.
- Each issue implemented on feature branch, committed with conventional messages referencing issue, pushed, draft PR created.
- Code linted/formatted, tests run if applicable.
- Progress reported after each issue.
- Clean merge history.
